# My dotfiles

## What's in here?

- Dotfiles for my following programs
  - Neovim
  - Zsh
  - Tmux
  - Vale

- For VS Code, since their extensions.json file contains some sensitive
info (aka, info about my directory structure), I will take the list of
extensions I currently have instead.
  - These extensions can be installed via the [convenience script](./vscode-install-extensions.sh)
