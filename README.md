- 2 wallpapers I use. Mainly [this one](./wallpaper.png).

- For VS Code, since their extensions.json file contains some sensitive
info (aka, info about my directory structure), I will take the list of
extensions I currently have instead.
  - These extensions can be installed via the [convenience script](./vscode-install-extensions.sh)

## Dependencies

- These are (NeoVim) stuff that cannot be download through Lazy and/or Mason.
  - ccls (currently not in use)
  - clang/clang++
  - clang-tools-extra (optional)
  - npm
  - python3
  - python3-venv
  - python3-pip
